    Definition

        The Nomen project is a multi-purpose rename tool to consistently
        rename the base name as well as the extension of files in a variety of
        ways and also to remove unnecessary whitespaces from directory names.

    Notice

        This is the last official version for the Python 2.x framework. If you
        need later versions for that framework for whatever reason, you can
        try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to version 2.x using the
        '3to2' tool.

        However, there is no guarantee that this works properly or at all.

    Requirements

        This version of Nomen was built for the Python 2.x framework. If you
        need a version that works with Python 3.x, you can also find one on
        the website of the project mentioned above.

        In order to use the project, Python 2.7 or higher is recommended, but
        it may also work with earlier versions.
