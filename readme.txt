    Definition

        The Nomen project is a multi-purpose rename tool to consistently
        rename the base name as well as the extension of files in a variety of
        ways and also to remove unnecessary whitespaces from directory names.

    Requirements

        In order to use Nomen and its components, Python 3.6 or higher must
        be installed.

        If you need a version for Python 2 for whatever reason, you can try
        refactoring the syntax using the 3to2 tool. However, there is no
        guarantee that this works properly or at all, and support for this is
        not provided in any way.

    Usage

        For fundamental documentation as well as some usage examples for each
        component of the project, you may have a look at the text files inside
        the included 'docs' sub-directory.
