    Definition

        The Nomen project is a multi-purpose rename tool to consistently
        rename the base name as well as the extension of files in a variety of
        ways and also to remove unnecessary whitespaces from directory names.

    Requirements

        In order to use the project, Python 3.2 or higher is recommended, but
        it may also work with earlier versions.

        If you need a version that works with Python 2.x, you can also find
        one on the website of the project mentioned above.

        However, version 2.3.6 is the last official release for the Python 2.x
        framework.

    Usage

        For fundamental documentation as well as some usage examples for each
        component of the project, you may have a look at the text files inside
        the included 'docs' sub-directory.
