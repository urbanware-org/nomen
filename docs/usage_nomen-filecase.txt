    1. Definition

        The Nomen File Name Case Converter script converts the case of the
        base name of all files inside a directory and (if requested) in all of
        its sub-directories.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, each script requires command-line arguments to operate.
            So, to get an overview of all arguments available, simply run the
            script with the "--help" argument. For example:

                $ ./nomen-filecase.py --help

        2.2 Warning

            Please use this tool with care to avoid data damage or loss!

            It is strongly recommended to simulate every rename process first
            to check which files would have been renamed. As a matter of fact,
            there is no function to undo the changes done by this tool, so you
            should be aware of what you are doing. If not, do NOT use this
            tool.

            Improper use (e. g. modifying files inside system directories)
            will corrupt your system!

        2.3 Simulation mode

            As already mentioned above, before renaming any files, you should
            simulate the rename process by using the "--simulate" argument.

            This argument requires a file path where the report of the rename
            process will be written to. When in simulation mode, no files will
            be renamed at all.

            So, if you have a command line like this

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m rename -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays

            but want to simulate the rename process and write the report into
            the file "/tmp/report.txt", simply add the argument

                --simulate /tmp/report.txt

            to the command line:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m rename -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays \
                                    --simulate /tmp/report.txt

    3. Convert the case of base names

        For example, you have a picture file with this file name

            my favorite holiday.jpg

        and you convert the case of the base name to title case, the file name
        will look like this:

            My Favorite Holiday.jpg

        But, for example, if file system is case senstive and the directory
        contains the files

            HOLIDAY.jpg
            holiday.jpg

        there would be a problem converting the case of the base name, because
        both target file names would be identical. So, to avoid that, the
        script also offers two operating modes.

        3.1 Rename mode

            The "rename mode" adds a numeric ID to the base name of the
            duplicate target file and converts the case:

                HOLIDAY.jpg      will be renamed to "Holiday.jpg"
                holiday.jpg      will be renamed to "Holiday_1.jpg"

            To use this mode and convert the base name of the files to title
            case, type:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m rename -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays

        3.2 Skip mode

            The "skip mode" simply skips the files where converting the case
            of the base name would result in duplicate file names:

                HOLIDAY.jpg      will be renamed to "Holiday.jpg"
                holiday.jpg      will be skipped

            To use this mode and convert the base name of the files to title
            case, type:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m skip -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays

    4. Using config files

        The Nomen File Name Case Converter script also comes with the feature
        that allows using config files to convert the case of certain strings
        always to lowercase, title case, uppercase or a user-defined mixed
        case, nomatter which target case (using the "-c" or "--case" argument)
        was given.

        For details see the included sample config files which can be found
        inside the "cfg" sub-directory.

        If the sample config file is missing for some reason, you may download
        the project from the website:

            http://www.urbanware.org/nomen.html

        To use these config files, the corresponding command-line argument
        followed by the full path to the config file is required, depending on
        which of the config files you want to use.

        4.1 With a certain target case

            For example, if you want to use title case as target case as well
            as the lowercase config file named "lower.cfg" which is located
            inside the directory "/tmp", the command line would look like
            this:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m skip -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays \
                                    --cfg-lower /tmp/lower.cfg

            To additionally use the uppercase config file "upper.cfg" which
            is also located inside the "/tmp" directory, simply add the
            appropriate argument:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m skip -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays \
                                    --cfg-lower /tmp/lower.cfg \
                                    --cfg-upper /tmp/upper.cfg

            Same with the mixed case config:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m skip -c title -d /tmp/pics/Holidays \
                                    --cfg-lower /tmp/lower.cfg \
                                    --cfg-mixed /tmp/mixed.cfg \
                                    --cfg-upper /tmp/upper.cfg

            However, you cannot use the title case config file when using
            title case as target case anyway.

        4.2 Without a certain target case

            If you just want to convert the case of the certain strings stored
            inside the case config files, you can do this by giving "config"
            as the target case:

                ./nomen-filecase.py -m skip -c config -d /tmp/pics/Holidays \
                                    --cfg-lower /tmp/lower.cfg \
                                    --cfg-mixed /tmp/mixed.cfg \
                                    --cfg-title /tmp/title.cfg \
                                    --cfg-upper /tmp/upper.cfg
